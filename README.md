# MCHQ
Mobile College Helper QR is my final year project, which revolve around creating an application that will start out as simple attendance tracker for the students to motivate them in keeping a log of their attendance along with a Reward system that increase the user "Level" each time they make a record  


## starting up the back end

Run "npm start" or "react-native start" in the root directory of your project before "react-native run-android".
